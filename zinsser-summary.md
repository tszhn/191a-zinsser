# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Tsz Hang Ng

Zinsser mentions what we have to pay attention on, to avoid writing unnecessary words when we write. As he found, there are so many unnecessary words exist in any kind of essays. Those words are pointless and unnuseful for putting them on the sentences. Writers use unnecessary words make the sentences even worse to read and to be more confusing. So, when we write sentences, we have to keep in mind to reread what we have written and see how we can delete the unnecessary words and make the sentence to be more clear and easier for readers to understand.
